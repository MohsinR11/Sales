🔑 Key Features

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared raw sales data for analysis.  
📅 Feature Engineering: Extracted time-based features like Year, Month, Day, and Weekday from the Date column.  
📊 Univariate Analysis: Visualized the relationship between Quantity and Profit using a scatter plot.  
🖼️ Visualizations: Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-portfolio-project.git


Install DependenciesEnsure you have Python 3.12+ installed. Install the required libraries:  
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib jupyter


Launch Jupyter NotebookNavigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook:  
cd ai-powered-portfolio-project
jupyter notebook


Open the NotebookIn your browser, open AI-powered portfolio project.ipynb to explore the analysis.



🚀 Usage

Run the NotebookExecute the cells in AI-powered portfolio project.ipynb sequentially to:  

Load and preprocess the sales dataset.  
Perform feature engineering.  
Generate visualizations.


Explore VisualizationsCheck the scatter plot in the Univariate Analysis section to understand the relationship between Quantity and Profit.

Customize the AnalysisModify the code to explore other metrics or create additional visualizations as needed.



🎨 Visualizations
Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot
The notebook includes a scatter plot showing the relationship between Quantity and Profit:  

X-Axis: Quantity sold (1 to 9).  
Y-Axis: Profit earned ($9.37 to $458.08).  
Observation: Identifies whether higher quantities sold correlate with higher profits.

Adding a Screenshot
To include a screenshot of the scatter plot:  

Run the notebook and save the scatter plot as an image (e.g., quantity_vs_profit.png).  
Create a screenshots folder in the repository root.  
Upload the image to the screenshots folder.  
Add the image to the README:  ![Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot](screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png)



Alternative: Use a Publicly Hosted Image LinkIf you prefer to host the image externally (e.g., on Imgur, Google Drive, etc.), use a direct URL:  
![Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot](https://example.com/screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png)

Replace https://example.com/screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png with the actual URL of your hosted image. Ensure the link is public and points directly to the image file (not a webpage).

📊 Additional Insights

Data Quality: No missing values or duplicates were found in the dataset.  
Feature Engineering: Added columns like Year, Month, Day, and Weekday for time-based analysis.  
Potential Extensions:  
Add more visualizations (e.g., revenue trends over time).  
Perform bivariate analysis (e.g., Revenue vs Region).  
Build a predictive model using machine learning to forecast sales.
