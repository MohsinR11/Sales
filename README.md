📊 AI-Powered Portfolio Project 🚀
🌟 Overview
Welcome to the AI-Powered Portfolio Project! 📓 This Jupyter Notebook project provides a detailed analysis of sales data, focusing on metrics like Revenue, Profit, and Quantity across dimensions such as Product, Category, Region, and Date. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualizations, offering insights into sales trends for 58 records. 📈

🔑 Key Metrics

📦 Total Records: 58  
💰 Average Revenue: $1,024.81 (Range: $63–$1,949)  
📊 Average Profit: $190.04 (Range: $9.37–$458.08)  
📅 Date Range: 2022-01-02 to 2024-12-12


🛠️ Project Features
The project is designed to help data analysts explore sales data with ease. Use the Jupyter Notebook to dive into the analysis and uncover trends in sales performance and patterns! 🔍

📊 Visualizations
Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot 📉

A scatter plot showing the relationship between Quantity and Profit.  
📈 Trend: Identifies whether higher quantities sold correlate with higher profits.  
X-Axis: Quantity sold (1 to 9).  
Y-Axis: Profit earned ($9.37 to $458.08).


🎨 Screenshots
Here’s a glimpse of the visualization! 🖼️  
Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot:
To include a screenshot of the scatter plot:  

Run the notebook and save the scatter plot as an image (e.g., quantity_vs_profit.png).  
Create a screenshots folder in the repository root.  
Upload the image to the screenshots folder.  
Add the image to the README:  ![Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot](screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png)



Alternative: Use a Publicly Hosted Image LinkIf you prefer to host the image externally (e.g., on Imgur, Google Drive, etc.), use a direct URL:  
![Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot](https://example.com/screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png)

Replace https://example.com/screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png with the actual URL of your hosted image. Ensure the link is public and points directly to the image file (not a webpage).

🧩 Dataset Details
The dataset (sales.csv) contains the following columns:  

📍 OrderID: Unique identifier for each order (e.g., 2001).  
📦 Product: Product sold (e.g., Printer, Monitor).  
🏬 Category: Product category (e.g., Office Supplies, Electronics).  
💰 Revenue: Revenue generated (e.g., $736).  
📊 Profit: Profit from the order (e.g., $119.55).  
📅 Date: Order date (e.g., 2023-07-18).  
🌍 Region: Region of sale (e.g., North, East).  
📏 Quantity: Number of items sold (e.g., 6).

Data Quality Insight: No missing values or duplicates were found in the dataset. ✅

🚀 Usage

Open the Notebook: Launch the Jupyter Notebook (AI-powered portfolio project.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. 📂  
Run the Cells: Execute the cells sequentially to load data, preprocess, engineer features, and generate visualizations. 📑  
Interact: Explore the scatter plot to understand relationships between metrics like Quantity and Profit. 🖱️  
Customize: Modify the code to explore other metrics or create new visualizations. 🔧


⚙️ Requirements
