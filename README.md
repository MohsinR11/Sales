🔑 Key Features

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw sales data for analysis.  
📅 Feature Engineering: Extracted time-based features like Year, Month, Day, and Weekday from the Date column.  
📊 Univariate Analysis: Visualized the relationship between Quantity and Profit using a scatter plot.  
🖼️ Visualizations: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful data visualizations.


📋 Dataset Details
The dataset (sales.csv) contains 58 records with the following columns:  

OrderID: Unique identifier for each order (e.g., 2001).  
Product: Product sold (e.g., Printer, Monitor).  
Category: Product category (e.g., Office Supplies, Electronics).  
Revenue: Revenue generated from the order (e.g., $736).  
Profit: Profit from the order (e.g., $119.55).  
Date: Order date (e.g., 2023-07-18).  
Region: Region of sale (e.g., North, East).  
Quantity: Number of items sold (e.g., 6).

Key Statistics

Revenue: Mean $1,024.81, Range $63–$1,949.  
Profit: Mean $190.04, Range $9.37–$458.08.  
Quantity: Mean 4.90, Range 1–9.  
Date Range: 2022-01-02 to 2024-12-12.


⚙️ Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-portfolio-project.git


Install Dependencies:Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed. Install the required libraries using:  
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib jupyter


Launch Jupyter Notebook:Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook:  
jupyter notebook


Open the Notebook:Open AI-powered portfolio project.ipynb in your browser to explore the analysis.



🚀 Usage

Run the Notebook:Execute the cells in AI-powered portfolio project.ipynb sequentially to:  

Load and preprocess the sales dataset.  
Perform feature engineering.  
Generate visualizations.


Explore the Visualizations:Check the scatter plot under Univariate Analysis to understand the relationship between Quantity and Profit.  

Modify the Analysis:Feel free to tweak the code to explore other metrics or create new visualizations!



🎨 Visualizations
Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot
The notebook includes a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Quantity and Profit:  

X-Axis: Quantity sold (1 to 9).  
Y-Axis: Profit earned ($9.37 to $458.08).  
Observation: The plot helps identify patterns, such as whether higher quantities sold correlate with higher profits.

Adding a Screenshot
To add a screenshot of the scatter plot:  

Run the notebook and save the scatter plot as an image (e.g., quantity_vs_profit.png).  
Create a screenshots folder in the repository root.  
Upload the image to the screenshots folder.  
Add the image to the README:  ![Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot](screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png)



Alternative: Use a Publicly Hosted Image LinkIf you prefer to host the image externally (e.g., on Imgur, Google Drive, etc.), use a direct URL:  
![Quantity vs Profit Scatter Plot](https://example.com/screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png)

Replace https://example.com/screenshots/quantity_vs_profit.png with the actual URL of your hosted image. Ensure the link is public and points directly to the image file (not a webpage).

📊 Additional Insights

Data Quality: No missing values or duplicates were found in the dataset.  
Feature Engineering: Added columns like Year, Month, Day, and Weekday to enable time-based analysis.  
Potential Extensions: You can extend the analysis by:  
Adding more visualizations (e.g., revenue trends over time).  
Performing bivariate analysis (e.g., Revenue vs Region).  
Building a predictive model using machine learning to forecast sales.
